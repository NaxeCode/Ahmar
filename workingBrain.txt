Ok, so here is my working brain
I've got to do critical thinking and ask myself if I prefer a game mechanic that dodges those thangs
or destroys them / hurts them.
I'm leaning towards the destroy them thing

Regardless though, I'm thinking of making a hitbox that extends outwards depending on the 
direction the player is moving in

So, basically, on the dash function, create a FlxPoint from where the player was, to where he is.
Use that to calculate 

Let's take my time trying to figure this part out, I know I'm on a relatively tight schedule. But when it comes to
solving problems, I need to take my time and try to think of how to solve these things through critical thinking.
Bit by bit, if I don't rob myself of solving these problems through frustraition or trying to find the answer quickly
from the get go. I feel like there is value in solving some of these on my own.

Anyways, There are a couple of bugs that need to be ironed out;
- When moving from the top right to bottom left, the shape doesn't quite materialize
- When moving from 

Let's work on Enemy AI,
- Enemy needs to move towards you,
- Once close enough, winds up animation.
- unleashes attack animation.
- knock-back animation playback

First of all, I need to make it so that:
- If player comes into contact with Enemy, they get hurt and knockback
- Organize player code for better readability

Let's seperate this todo into 2 sections, Enemy and player

Player ==
- Upon colliding or intersecting with an Enemy, player looses health, get's knocked back [X]
- Player is invincible for 0.5 seconds after getting hit.
- Setup Player spawn type (Rock, Paper, Scissors)
- Setup RPS modifiers (Dmg, Defense, Health, Stamina)

===

Stage ==
- Add text on screen representing the following:
-- Player HP amount
-- Player Stamina amount
-- Player Damage Power
-- Player Defense Power
-- Player current "Type" (Rock, Paper, or Scissors)
-- Player modified Damage Power and Defense Power against X type Enemy
-- Current Wave Count
-- Current Wave Enemy Type Information, "how many enemies are left of X Y and Z type"

===


Enemy ==
- Add healthbar to Enemy [X]
- Upon taking damage, make Enemy "flash" (add a function that controls damage taken)
- Add regular attack in addition to "Rush" attack
- For "Rush" attack, if hit player, kill momentum, as the player will be invincible
- Setup Enemy spawn type (Rock, Paper, Scissors) Color code each type
- Have their type affect Player conditions, Damage dealt + defense modifier
- Implement "waves" into the game, Add option to change from "Steady Waves" to "Mixed Waves".
