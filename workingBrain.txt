Ok, so here is my working brain
I've got to do critical thinking and ask myself if I prefer a game mechanic that dodges those thangs
or destroys them / hurts them.
I'm leaning towards the destroy them thing

Regardless though, I'm thinking of making a hitbox that extends outwards depending on the 
direction the player is moving in

So, basically, on the dash function, create a FlxPoint from where the player was, to where he is.
Use that to calculate 

Let's take my time trying to figure this part out, I know I'm on a relatively tight schedule. But when it comes to
solving problems, I need to take my time and try to think of how to solve these things through critical thinking.
Bit by bit, if I don't rob myself of solving these problems through frustraition or trying to find the answer quickly
from the get go. I feel like there is value in solving some of these on my own.

Anyways, There are a couple of bugs that need to be ironed out;
- When moving from the top right to bottom left, the shape doesn't quite materialize
- When moving from 

Let's work on Enemy AI,
- Enemy needs to move towards you,
- Once close enough, winds up animation.
- unleashes attack animation.
- knock-back animation playback

First of all, I need to make it so that:
- If player comes into contact with Enemy, they get hurt and knockback
- Organize player code for better readability

Let's seperate this todo into 2 sections, Enemy and player

Player ==
- Upon colliding or intersecting with an Enemy, player looses health, get's knocked back [X]
- Player is invincible for 0.5 seconds after getting hit.
- Setup Player spawn type (Rock, Paper, Scissors)
- Setup RPS modifiers (Dmg, Defense, Health, Stamina)

===

Stage ==
- Add text on screen representing the following:
-- Player HP amount
-- Player Stamina amount
-- Player Damage Power
-- Player Defense Power
-- Player current "Type" (Rock, Paper, or Scissors)
-- Player modified Damage Power and Defense Power against X type Enemy
-- Current Wave Count
-- Current Wave Enemy Type Information, "how many enemies are left of X Y and Z type"

===


Enemy ==
- Add healthbar to Enemy [X]
- Upon taking damage, make Enemy "flash" (add a function that controls damage taken)
- Add regular attack in addition to "Rush" attack
- For "Rush" attack, if hit player, kill momentum, as the player will be invincible
- Setup Enemy spawn type (Rock, Paper, Scissors) Color code each type
- Have their type affect Player conditions, Damage dealt + defense modifier
- Implement "waves" into the game, Add option to change from "Steady Waves" to "Mixed Waves".


===
Enemy ideas:
-Small enemy chips damage
-Can be thrown by larger enemies to do bigger damage
===

It's hard trying to get the enemies to be defeatable.

It's difficult getting the enemies to be balanced.

AGH, there is so much to do...
I'm GOING TO GIVE IT EVERYTHING I'VE GOT! HAHA: )
What are the raw emotions I want to play during the product? How do I really want to feel while fighting these *things*??
I can't really think of a game that's too similar to this product

As far as aesthetics go, I want something potentially Pastel Blue, Pink, and White.
So it'd be a blue background... with Pink characters and white attacks / slashes? what would that kinda look like
I guess I'm just trying to figure out 

=== Plan to get the combo mechanic juuuust right
Psudo code:
1. if Z button pressed
2. combo attack starts
3. player when attacking, hones in on enemy, starts wailing.

basically the player's attacks should "connect" when fighting.
I need some more information in order to make this work.
How about I make the first hit NOT connect, and use that first hit to initiate the combo sequence?
Yeah... then after that, within a time limit of a couple seconds, spamming Z gets you to hone in on that specific enemy
it'll also solve the problem of having the other characters get caught in the cross-fire.
